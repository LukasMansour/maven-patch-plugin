This new Maven Patch Plugin is a simple to use plugin for maven, that allows you to use patch files
(e.g. created by git) in your building process. Importantly, this plugin does not use GNU Patch and
therefore it can be used on Windows machines and does not require any container configurations in
your builds.

This plugin was created by Lukas Mansour in 2024 primarily for
the [dCache](https://github.com/dCache/dcache) project. It primarily uses a java native patching
library called [java-diff-utils](https://github.com/java-diff-utils/java-diff-utils).

## Install

### Maven

This plugin is only available for Maven and can be installed with the following plugin snippet:

```xml

<plugin>
  <groupId>io.github.lukasmansour</groupId>
  <artifactId>patch-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <configuration>
    <targetDirectory>${project.basedir}</targetDirectory>
    <patchDirectory>${project.basedir}\src\main\patches</patchDirectory>
  </configuration>

  <!-- And add the execution to the building phase-->
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>apply</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

## Usage

In the plugin you can configure a ```targetDirectory``` and a ```patchDirectory```.
the ```targetDirectory``` is the root in which patches will be applied. The ```patchDirectory``` is
the location of the patches.

There is also an example in the repository [here](../test-project).
